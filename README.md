## <a name="introduction">🤖 Introduction</a>

A healthcare application leveraging machine learning to predict the likelihood of multiple diseases, including Parkinson's, diabetes, and heart disease. Users can easily input their medical information parameters and generate prediction results using individual machine learning models for each disease. The application features a user-friendly interface with a sidebar for switching between different disease predictors and is deployed using Streamlit.
